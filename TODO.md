# TODO: Create Attendee Register Page

- [x] Create new file `src/pages/AttendeeDashBoard/RegisterForEvent.jsx` with the provided identical code.
- [x] Modify `src/components/attendee_discover/attendee-discover.jsx` to change navigation from `/organizer-view-event/${id}` to `/attendee-register/${id}`.
- [x] Add route in `src/App.jsx` for `/attendee/register/:id` to use the new AttendeeRegisterForEvent component.
- [x] Verified navigation works correctly from attendee discover to the new register page (dev server running on http://localhost:5174).
- [x] Ensured no organizer routes are accessed (attendee routes are separate).
